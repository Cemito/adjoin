The 2017sssd.sh script adds Linux machines to Active Directory using SSSD daemon.
This has been tested and working on Ubuntu.

"datadrive.sh" - Installs GParted, formats secondary drive, mounts the drive and changes ownership of the drive to the user you select so they have full read read write permissions.

"u_corpjoin.sh" - Adds the computer to Active Directory using PBIS. (Use SSSD as this is a better method). 

"dns_fix.sh" - Only needs to be run on computers added to Active Directory using PBIS if they cannot be pinged or accessed.
